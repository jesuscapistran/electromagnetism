## Electric fields 

- Q~+~  (Charge) 
- Electric Field lines 
- Electric Field strength 
  - Closer field lines means stronger electric field
- If the  electric field line is straight 
  - A positive charge in the electric field will have a force in the same direction of the electric field. 
- If the electric field  line is curved 
  - A positive particle will have a force  tangent to the electric field line. 
- Field configuration
  - (-4)  (-1) repel
  - (+4) (+1) repel

## Dipole

- Two charges equal in magnitude but positive in sign  = dipole
- There is no single space where the electric field is zero. 
- Are dipoles rare in physics? They are common 
- Dipole in class = Dipole in conductors
-  Dipole in an electric field = dipole rotate
