Mass of the proton = mass of the neutron = 1.67x10^-27^ kg 



Benjamin Franking introduce the idea of the electric charge 

	- Sign convention  (Excess of fire is positive)
	- Conservation of charge
	- Plus and plus  repeles 
	- Minus and minus repeles each other 
	- Plus and minus attracts each other 

---

Positive charges:  Silk and glass (Chosen by Benjamin Franklin)

Negative charges:  Cat fur and rubber 



---

Friction can create electric charge

Van der Graff (Super amber rod)

- Demonstration



---

Coulomb Law 

- Law of coulomb 
- Micro-coulomb
- q = 1.6x10-19 C

---

Net force (add a q3 charge)

- Use superposition principle 
- Electrical forces are more powerful than gravitational 

---

Measure instruments for charge 

- Electroscope
